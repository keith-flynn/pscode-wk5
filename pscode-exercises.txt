// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Take number
    if number modulo 2 = 0

Take five numbers
Add numbers to list

// b
Add all numbers in the list together, and divide that by 5

// c
sort(list_of_numbers)

// d
print average
print list_of_numbers[0] and list_of_numbers[4]
